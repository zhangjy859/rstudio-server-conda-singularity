### run this script

1) clone this project and cd to project directory

2) activate conda environment you want
`conda activate env_name`

3) run script
```
WORKDIRECTORY="/path/to/your/rproject/workdir/" PORT=8787 PASSWORD=PASSWORD ./run_singularity.sh #change the port number if your port is already occupied (for example, another rstudio server is running)
```

Your `r project` directory will mount on '/data' in rstudio server

4) visit `http://your_server_ip:8787`

Note: if your server is under a firewall, I recommend using SSH port forwarding.

eg: 

```
# keep this ssh connect running throughout the entire session
ssh user_name@your_server_ip -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787
```

visit http://127.0.0.1:8787
